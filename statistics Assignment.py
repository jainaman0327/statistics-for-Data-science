# Question 1.What exactly is the difference between descriptive and inferential statistics?
# 
# Ans: Descriptive statistics summarize the characteristics of a data set. Inferential statistics allow you to test a hypothesis or assess whether your data is generalizable to the broader population.

# Question 2. I'm not sure what is the difference between a sample and a population?
# 
# Ans: A population is the entire group that you want to draw conclusions about.
# 
# A sample is the specific group that you will collect data from. The size of the sample is always less than the total size of the population.
# 
# In research, a population doesnâ€™t always refer to people. It can mean a group containing elements of anything you want to study, such as objects, events, organizations, countries, species, organisms, etc.

# Question 3.What distinguishes descriptive statistics from other types of statistics?
# 
# Ans:Descriptive statistics summarize the characteristics of a data set. 
# Inferential statistics allow you to test a hypothesis or assess whether your data is
# generalizable to the broader population.

# Question 4. What is the difference between quantitative and qualitative data?
# 
# Ans: Quantitative data is numbers-based, countable, or measurable.
# Qualitative data is interpretation-based, descriptive, and relating to language.
# Quantitative data tells us how many, how much, or how often in calculations.
# Qualitative data can help us to understand why, how, or what happened behind certain behaviors.

# Question 5.What is the definition of a percentile?
# 
# Ans: A percentile (or a centile) is a measure used in
# statistics indicating the value below which a given percentage 
# of observations in a group of observations fall. For example, 
# the 20th percentile is the value (or score) below which 20% of the observations may be found.
# 
# The term percentile and the related term percentile rank are often used in the reporting of scores
# from norm-referenced tests. For example, if a score is at the 86th percentile, where 86 is the percentile rank, 
# it is equal to the value below which 86% of the observations may be found. In contrast, if it is in the 86th percentile,
# the score is at or below the value of which 86% of the observations may be found. Every score is in the 100th percentile.
# The 25th percentile is also known as the first quartile (Q1), the 50th percentile as the median or second quartile (Q2),
# and the 75th percentile as the third quartile (Q3). In general, percentiles and quartiles are specific types of quantiles.
