# Question 1.How can we figure out what the interquartile range is?
# 
# Ans:The IQR describes the middle 50% of values when ordered from lowest to highest.
# To find the interquartile range (IQR), 
# â€‹first find the median (middle value) of the lower and upper half of the data.
# These values are quartile 1 (Q1) and quartile 3 (Q3). 
# The IQR is the difference between Q3 and Q1.

# Question 2. What exactly is the value of the 5-number theory?
# 
# Ans: Reporting five numbers avoids the need to decide on the 
# most appropriate summary statistic.
# The five-number summary gives information about the location (from the median),
# spread (from the quartiles) and range (from the sample minimum and maximum) of 
# the observations.

# Question 3.What is the relationship between standard deviation and variance?
# 
# Ans: Variance is the square of standard deviation.
# Both variance and standard deviation are always positive. If all the observations in a data set are identical, then the standard deviation and variance will be zero.

# Question 4.What does the difference between variance and standard deviation mean?
# 
# Ans:Standard deviation is the spread of a group of numbers from the mean.
# The variance measures the average degree to which each point differs from the mean. 
# While standard deviation is the square root of the variance, 
# variance is the average of all data points within a group. 

# Question 5.When is it appropriate to refer to a skewed data distribution?
# 
# Ans:A skewed distribution is neither symmetric nor normal because
# the data values trail off more sharply on one side than on the other. 
# In business, you often find skewness in data sets that represent sizes
# using positive numbers (eg, sales or assets).
